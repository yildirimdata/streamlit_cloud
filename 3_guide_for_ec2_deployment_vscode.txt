Remote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files  Studio Code - Edit SSH configuration files



1.Keep the following files in a folder or push them to the github

   -saved model
   -app.py file (streamlit commands)
   -requirements.txt and other files

2. open your aws console

3. Open EC2 Dashboard and Launch Instance (t2.micro )

   - enter EC2 name (ex: hillary-deneme1)
   - aws linux machine
   - t2.micro 
   - Key pair login- create a new key pair- with default settings
   - Name your key pem and download it (automatically downladed)
   - store your key pair on your computer
   - click "launch instance" button
   - then you can see the "success message" about the instance was successfully launched     

4. Security Group Settings from Network Settings

   - after the instance get running state, click the check box in front of the new instance
   - click Security (On the right side of details from the bottom part)
   - For Inbound rules click launch-wizard-5
   - click "inbound rules" next to the details and click "Edit inbound rules"
   - click "Add rule"

5. Due to we want our app to be public we should set following configurations:

   (Add Rule 2 times by clicking on Add Rule button)

   a. Rule-1: Select "Custom TCP Rule" and set 8501 as port range and 0000 in soruce column (Anywhere IPv4)

Together with the default rule (starting with SSH) there will be 3 rules.

      - copy Public Public IP address from AWS EC2 Instance Connect page and paste it to config file as HostName
      - copy the path of key pair from your computer and paste it to config file as IdentityFile
      - finally save config file

7. Connect to instance using VS Code

   a. Connect to host (Left bottom corner green icon on VS Code)
   b. Connect to host and Select the host name (the name from config file)
   c. Select linux and continue
   d. Click on Terminal and see we have connected to the EC2

 
8. Copy app files into ec2

   - Create folder in ec2 using terminal or using file tab ("mkdir foldername" from terminal)
   - change directory to new folder
     cd foldername
   - Copy files from desktop into new folder by drag-drop method

   or 
 
   if you cannot copy via vscode use secure copy method:

     scp -i richard_new_3.pem requirements.txt ec2-user@52.71.254.30:/home/ec2-user/streamlit6
                  
     (your keypair should at the same the directory with target data)

   or

   use git clone method:

   push the files to git
   then on terminal:
      $ sudo yum install git
      $ git clone https://github.com/hllry2022/MLD_Streamlit_Cloud.gitt  (before that you need to copy the htpps addres from your git accout)


9. type python and python3 to see python versions ("exit()" to escape)

   to update python: 

      sudo yum update -y 

   to insall python3 if there is no python3:    
  
      $ sudo yum install python3.8  (ec2 supports 3.8)
   or
      sudo amazon-linux-extras install python3.8
 

10. to create venv and install packages into env in ec2

    python3 -m venv env_name

11.to activate venv(maybe pip required -----python -m pip3 install -U pip-------)
source env_name/bin/activate


12. install required packages inside this folder s(foldername) in ec2

   - pip3 install sklearn (sudo python3.7 -m pip install sklearn)
   or (sudo python3.7 -m pip install scikit-learn==1.0.2)
   - pip3 install streamlit==1.10.0  or (sudo python3.7 -m pip install streamlit)

   or

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   (pip list) to see the packages
   (pip freeze > requirement.txt) to create requirement file


13. to run app
   streamlit run app.py

   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

      Network URL: http://172.31.28.28:8501
      External URL: http://18.188.133.122:8501


   (When you close the git bash no matter the instance is working the app will stop. To prevent the app from this or in other words to let it work even you exit from the gitbash you should install tmux)

14. to stop running app
    "Control C"

15. to install the tmux

   $ sudo yum install tmux

16. to create a new tmux session

   # tmux new -s st_instance

17. run the app 

   $ streamlit run app.py

Then it is ok. Even if you close the gitbash or what ever you are using for linux, the app will continue to work.

   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.                                                                                     
      Network URL: http://172.31.21.107:8501                                        
      External URL: http://3.17.161.155:8501 

18. to detach from tmux session
   "control b" then remove your fingers from keyboard then "d"

   this for to detach (if you again want to attach: tmux attach -t st_instance)

19. to kill the session
   tmux kill-session -t st_instance
